# Usage: bundle-appimage.sh <target-triple> <arch-label>
# Package the release binary into a self-contained AppImage:
#   dist/nermal-<version>-linux-<arch>.AppImage
#
# Unlike the bare tarball (bundle-linux.sh), this bundles the x11/wayland/xkb/
# fontconfig/freetype runtime libraries alongside the binary, so it launches on
# distros that don't ship the exact same set Ubuntu does — Fedora, Arch, etc.
# (glibc itself is NOT bundled — an AppImage still needs the host glibc to be
# >= the build machine's, so the release runner's Ubuntu sets the floor.)
#
# Completion signatures are loaded at runtime relative to the executable
# (<exe-dir>/completions — see terminal::signature), so they go beside the
# binary at usr/bin/completions inside the AppDir.
