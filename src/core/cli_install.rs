//! Putting the bundled `nermal` CLI on PATH, without asking and without an entry
//! point to click.
//!
//! The GUI and the CLI ship as one artifact but are two binaries: the installer
//! lays `nermal` down beside `nermal-app` (inside `Contents/MacOS/` on macOS, in the
//! install directory elsewhere) and neither one is on PATH by virtue of being
//! there. Rather than a "Install shell command…" menu item that most people
//! never find, the GUI links it up itself on every launch — cheap enough to run
//! unconditionally, idempotent once it has succeeded.
//!
//! Two platform shapes, for reasons that are not symmetric:
//!
//! * **Unix** — symlink the CLI into a directory that is already on PATH. The
//!   alternative, putting our own directory on PATH, would mean editing the
//!   user's shell rc: a macOS GUI app inherits nothing from the login shell and
//!   cannot export into it. Writing to someone's `.zshrc` is a far bigger thing
//!   to do unprompted than dropping one symlink.
//! * **Windows** — the reverse. Symlinks need Developer Mode or elevation, and
//!   there is no conventional user-writable bin directory on PATH to link into.
//!   `HKCU\Environment` is the native answer and needs no privileges.
//!
//! Nothing here is fatal. Every failure path logs and returns; a user whose
//! system resists all of it still has a working GUI, just no `nermal` on PATH.
//!
//! Undoing it is asymmetric too. The Windows uninstaller strips the PATH entry
//! back out (see the `[Code]` section of `windows-installer.iss`). Unix has no
//! uninstall hook to hang that off — dragging the `.app` to the Trash or
//! deleting the tarball leaves the symlink behind, dangling. An upgrade heals
//! it (a dangling link still names `nermal`, so the next launch repoints it); a
//! real uninstall leaves one broken entry the user removes by hand.
