//! A file that says "an installer is replacing this installation right now".
//!
//! Between `spawn::stop_for_update` clearing the installed images and the
//! installer finishing, nothing used to stop a `nermal` CLI call — or a
//! manually launched GUI — from spawning a fresh daemon that relocks the very
//! files being replaced. The guard closes that window: whoever drives the
//! installation holds it, and `spawn::ensure_running` refuses to spawn a
//! daemon while it is held. Only spawning is deferred; connecting to a daemon
//! that is already running stays untouched.
//!
//! The guard names its holder by pid, and a pid is only believed to be the
//! holder while the process behind it *could* be: it must be alive, and it
//! must have started before the guard was written — a process born later
//! merely inherited the number. That check is what lets a holder keep the
//! guard for as long as its installation genuinely runs (an install slowed
//! past any fixed budget by an antivirus sweep stays protected), while a
//! crashed holder's guard goes stale the moment its pid dies or is recycled.
//! Only when the start time cannot be read at all does a TTL bound the doubt.
//!
//! Two kinds of holder:
//! - the auto-updater (`nermal-updater.exe install`/`install-portable`) holds
//!   for itself, from stopping the daemon until it relaunches the app;
//! - the `--stop-daemon --update-install-dir` helper that Inno's
//!   `PrepareToInstall`/`[UninstallRun]` runs holds for its *parent* — the
//!   Setup or uninstaller that keeps replacing files long after the helper
//!   returns. Nobody clears that one; it goes stale when Setup exits.
